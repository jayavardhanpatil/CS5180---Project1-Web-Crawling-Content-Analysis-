    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenae Butler has been a Googler for just under a year, but she became well-known both inside and outside of the company in June during a national spotlight on racial injustices here in the U.S. She created a presentation to help her colleagues understand what was going on; people found it so helpful that her “&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ltJmjs20m1rQGXPesYRi7zLq35mgWELQO8oFOrD1UlM/edit" target="_blank"&gt;Standing United&lt;/a&gt;” resource spread quickly within Google as well as on social media. It starts with the context of George Floyd’s death and the impact police brutality has on the Black community while offering actionable tips and advice for anyone looking to learn how to be a better ally to marginalized communities of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We sat down with Jenae to hear about how she navigated her own path as a Black woman in tech, and how she advises her peers to practice allyship successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about your path to Google.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When I was in college, internships in the technical field felt hard to obtain. It seemed like businesses were looking for a student who already had experience or other qualifications—which I found to be odd. I was a computer info systems major at Georgia State University and was looking to get into project management. I wasn't lucky enough to get an internship at the time but I found a back door into technology by working at Microsoft’s retail stores. That was my first time getting real exposure to the tech field and ended up being the reason I got into my career field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I transitioned from the retail side of Microsoft through a college hire program offered by the company. I worked as a consultant focused on SQL-themed projects and eventually made my way into program management for Microsoft’s retail store support team. In that time I was heavily involved in community outreach through their Black community employee resource group (ERG) which is where my love for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) stemmed from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came to Google after 5 years of working at Microsoft to join the Cloud Systems team as a program manager in Austin. My team focuses on the continued improvement and maintenance of rep-facing tools. At that time, I was a technical program manager working directly with the engineers, tasked with maintaining their workloads by lifting blockers and collaborating with the product owners for timely solution deliveries. I now work as an enablement program manager for the same team, with a new focus on training and communication mediums.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about the creation of the Standing United deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;A common theme in my career is being one of the very few Black people and/or women on my team. The upside to this is that I’ve gotten comfortable working in these spaces that are typically white-male dominated and can normally find ways to show impact. However, I find these spaces to typically be uncomfortable when racially charged protests begin.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having had those firsthand experiences, I knew that George Floyd’s death would spark conversations. I know how uncomfortable it can be for Black people to engage in this topic because it's complex and is a conversation that is often met with resistance or defensiveness by non-Black people. While Google has many existing resources, I wanted to find a way to aid my team with information as well as process my own thoughts and translate my own experiences as a way to equip myself. I did not realize that my work would resonate for so many Googlers around the company.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't predict that the deck would make its way into so many resource hubs, team meetings, and external networks. I’ve had the opportunity to speak to thousands of people over the summer, contribute to countless DEI working sessions and events, and even join some of these work groups and resource groups as a committee lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was afraid to do something this big, but allowing my natural instincts to guide me has had amazing results. I think we all can be shocked by what bravery produces—especially in regards to racial equity. I think it's a must for those who want to be impactful and really change outdated and incorrect narratives and the systems that are structured around them. For myself, I didn't realize that my small action would cause such a widespread impact.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe this same sort of effort can be repeated by everyone, honestly. Any effort—of any capacity—can create a ripple effect and inspire more folks and change than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you have advice for others, particularly Black women in tech?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Be yourself, whoever that is. You don’t have to look, act, or talk a certain way to be successful. I bring my locs, tattoos and piercings to work as a Black woman from the South every day. You may have to make sacrifices for your career, like location, but identity shouldn’t be one of them. Take time to find your community so you can have a home away from home—especially if you have to sacrifice leaving your community to pursue your career.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Black woman's corporate experience requires so much strategy and as you try to find your place in this white-male dominated space, remember to commit to finding ways to show impact in whatever capacity you can. Your journey will be a sum of your persistence to overcome the challenges you will face, finding flexibility in your methods and staying committed to your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-pull_quote"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-pull-quote h-c-page"&gt;&lt;section class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy"&gt;&lt;q class="uni-pull-quote__text"&gt;Allyship can be defined as supporting those in marginalized groups to which one does not identify.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="jenae butler.png" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/jenae_butler.max-1000x1000.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tackling climate change requires rapidly transitioning the entire global economy to clean energy and Google Cloud will be at the forefront of this transition.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has a long track record on clean energy: in 2007, Google became the &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-sustainability.appspot.com/pdf/10-years-carbon-neutrality.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; major company to become carbon neutral. And in 2017, Google became the &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/environment/meeting-our-match-buying-100-percent-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; company of our size to match 100% of its electricity consumption with renewable energy. Today, Google Cloud is the only major cloud provider to purchase enough renewable energy to cover our entire operations, and over the years, we’ve &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-biggest-renewable-energy-purchase-ever/" target="_blank"&gt;purchased more wind and solar power than any other corporation in history&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wind and solar power don’t work in all places at all times. Though we buy enough renewable energy on average to match our data centers' electricity consumption, that average is an annual average. Thus, for a particular data center, at any given time we may have too much renewable power, or too little. When we have too much, we feed it into the local grid so someone else can consume it. When we have too little, we draw power from the local grid, and that power may not be renewable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hourly_carbon-free_perfor.0756029814350498.max-2800x2800.jpg" rel="external" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="hourly carbon-free performance.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/hourly_carbon-free_perfor.0756029814350498.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image__caption "&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;FIGURE 1 - While Google buys enough wind and solar power (symbolized by green spikes above) to be 100% renewable in a yearly, global average, these resources are variable, meaning that our data centers still sometimes rely on carbon-based resources.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-third-decade-climate-action-realizing-carbon-free-future" target="_blank"&gt;set our most ambitious energy goal yet&lt;/a&gt;: to run our business on carbon-free energy everywhere, at all times, by 2030. This means we’re aiming to always have our data centers supplied with carbon-free energy. We are the first cloud provider to make this commitment, and we intend to be the first to achieve it, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/around-the-clock_clean_energy.max-2800x2800.jpg" rel="external" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="around-the-clock clean energy.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/around-the-clock_clean_energy.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image__caption "&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;FIGURE 2 - ‘Round-the-clock clean energy is the final and most ambitious step on Google’s energy journey.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As IDC EMEA’s Technology for Sustainability and Social Impact Practice Lead Marta Muñoz notes, “Committing to ensuring carbon-free workloads across all regions is a significant step, enabling organizations all over the world in their own journeys to becoming sustainable businesses. In regions currently considering stricter regulations and looking to incentivize a path toward carbon neutrality, like Europe, Google's approach should empower its customers to excel in the new green economy.”&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the goal to reach 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, we can demonstrate that a carbon-free economy is possible. Our data centers are large power consumers, and if we can achieve 24/7 carbon-free energy for our data center fleet, economically, we can demonstrate that carbon-free electricity grids are within reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve already made a lot of progress, and in the coming years we’ll double down on our efforts. For instance, we recently announced a system that can &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/data-centers-work-harder-sun-shines-wind-blows/" target="_blank"&gt;shift flexible computing tasks&lt;/a&gt; to times when power on the grid is cleanest, while in Nevada we’ve proposed one of the world’s largest &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/google-inks-huge-ci-deal-in-nevada-with-a-prominent-place-for-storage" target="_blank"&gt;solar-plus-storage projects&lt;/a&gt;. We’re also using machine learning to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy/" target="_blank"&gt;optimize how wind farms deliver power&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, as we learn by doing, we’ll help develop useful tools to empower others to follow suit. In the last decade, we've led the way in deploying renewable energy at scale—and, in the process, helped drive down costs for wind and solar. It’s time to do the same for next-generation technologies that will allow for a wholesale transition to 24/7 carbon-free energy.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re developing tools to help our customers measure the impact of migrating to Google Cloud, report on their emissions, and reduce them. We’re also building the Industrial Adaptive Controls platform in collaboration with DeepMind, which provides AI control of cooling systems in commercial and industrial facilities. In the US alone, 12% of all electricity is used for heating and cooling of commercial buildings&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Now, the same AI technology that helps &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/data-centers-energy-efficient/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the energy we use to cool our data centers by 30%&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;will be available to the world’s largest industrial enterprises, building management software providers, and data center operators.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in running your company on the only cloud provider that has achieved 100% renewable energy, we’re here &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/contact"&gt;to help you&lt;/a&gt; along the way. Click &lt;a href="https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/247-carbon-free-energy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about our plans to move to 24/7 carbon-free energy. And be sure to read &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-third-decade-climate-action-realizing-carbon-free-future" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s broader sustainability announcement&lt;/a&gt;, which includes our commitment to 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, a EUR10 million Google Impact Challenge focused on mitigating climate change, and several other actions to help Google users make smarter decisions for the planet every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1.&nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.ase.org/initiatives/buildings" target="_blank"&gt;Alliance to Save Energy&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/commercial-buildings.php" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-related_article_tout"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout h-c-page"&gt;&lt;section class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;a class="uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker" data-analytics='{ "event": "page interaction", "category": "article lead", "action": "related article - inline", "label": "article: {slug}" }' href="https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/topics/google-cloud-next/our-heads-in-the-cloud-but-were-keeping-the-earth-in-mind/"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow"&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image" style="background-image: url('https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/GCP_World_Map.max-500x500.jpg')"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content"&gt;&lt;h4 class="uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin"&gt;Our head’s in the cloud, but we’re keeping the earth in mind&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__body"&gt;Take a look at sustainability sessions from Google Cloud Next ‘19 and learn more about how Google works to reduce its environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted"&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class="icon h-c-icon" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#mi-arrow-forward" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the third consecutive year, Gartner has positioned Google Cloud as a Leader in the 2020 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services (formerly Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS). As our customers and communities continue to weather uncertainty in 2020 and beyond, we’re focused on ensuring that our customers are resilient and agile. This year, we strengthened and enriched our offerings to help our customers adjust and plan for the future, and we believe Gartner’s analysis and recognition gives customers the confidence they need as they make important platform choices.&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since last year, we substantially improved our position in the Leader’s Quadrant, both for our “ability to execute” as well as our “completeness of vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/next20-onair-infrastructure-news"&gt;we showed at Google Cloud Next ‘20: OnAir&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cloud is built on top of leading infrastructure whose simplicity and ease of use is made possible by sophisticated management and security capabilities. Digital natives and traditional enterprises alike have chosen Google Cloud over the last year as we increased our pace of innovation with services such as updates to &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos/"&gt;Anthos&lt;/a&gt;, the launch of &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine"&gt;VMWare Engine&lt;/a&gt; and the introduction of &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/active-assist"&gt;Active Assist&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few. With Anthos, Google Cloud customers enjoy the ability to run their workloads where they see fit—on Google Cloud, in their own on-premises data center, or in third-party clouds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gartner positioned Google as a Leader for its completeness of vision in data analytics and machine learning, as well as long-standing investments in open-source projects such as Kubernetes and TensorFlow. By leveraging Google technologies, Google Cloud makes it simple for customers to build and deploy applications with unique, useful capabilities that delight their customers—and we look forward to continuing to bring Google’s ingenuity to enterprise organizations.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud’s combination of high-performance, expansive infrastructure plus best-in-class managed services resonates with some of the world’s leading organizations. Multinational retail giant Carrefour runs SAP on Google Cloud, as does Wipro Limited, an information technology consulting provider. German consumer electronics retailer MediaMrktSaturn built its omni-channel retail platform on GKE and BigQuery, and beverage manufacturer Keurig Dr. Pepper retired two data centers, each with over 1,000 servers, and migrated to Google Cloud.

   <title>Ramping up cloud migration discovery and assessment with StratoZone</title>

   <description>
    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses around the world have been impacted by the global pandemic, making the need to migrate to the cloud more urgent than ever. On their own, many organizations have difficulty completing cloud migrations on time and on budget. Among their challenges: unknown capacity needs and sizing; unknown performance thresholds; navigating expensive hardware refresh cycles or contract renewals; understanding licensing and support issues; and compliance and security concerns.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Google Cloud, we believe migrating to the cloud must be simple and provide clear advantages. We recently launched &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/cloud-migration/google-cloud-ramp-program-simplifies-cloud-migration"&gt;RAMP&lt;/a&gt;, our holistic migration program that provides the best of our expertise, services, partners, and tools to enable a simpler, faster path to cloud success. RAMP helps customers unlock their cloud potential through repeatable processes with predictable results for cloud migrations. To accelerate the assessment and planning phases, we acquired StratoZone, a migration discovery and assessment specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, StratoZone has helped thousands of companies understand their data center footprint, plan out their migration, and make the jump to the cloud. Now as part of Google Cloud, their technology and expertise supports enterprises who are looking to accelerate their cloud migrations, helping discover, assess, and understand complex dependencies across workloads moving to the cloud.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our cloud migration program, these tools will help you more predictably evaluate your IT landscape and plan what can move, what should move, and in what order. This means a migration program that is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fast&lt;/b&gt;: Assess your workloads quickly, with a solution that takes very little time to install and run (typically under 45 minutes), and can scale to discover and assess thousands of assets in hours. Initial results are typically available in days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easy&lt;/b&gt; to use: Discover workloads and assets using an agentless process. No appliances, hardware, or agents to deploy. Discovery is hypervisor and physical/virtual agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secure&lt;/b&gt;: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Customers control data anonymization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on best practices: Recommendations for optimal migration and modernization targets based on existing assets (including estimating TCO), proposing an optimal mix of cloud services as well as migration phases that minimize application disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-video"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module article-video "&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="h-c-video h-c-video--marquee" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile="true" data-glue-modal-trigger="uni-modal-oK8-jejegH8-" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=oK8-jejegH8"&gt;&lt;img alt="Saving costs and eliminating the unknowns using Stratozone." src="//img.youtube.com/vi/oK8-jejegH8/maxresdefault.jpg"/&gt;&lt;svg class="h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white" role="img"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#mi-youtube-icon"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-video__caption h-c-page"&gt;&lt;h4 class="h-c-headline h-c-headline--four h-u-font-weight-medium h-u-mt-std"&gt;How to get started with discovery and assessment for your migration&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-modal--video" data-glue-modal="uni-modal-oK8-jejegH8-" data-glue-modal-close-label="Close Dialog"&gt;&lt;a class="glue-yt-video" data-glue-yt-video-autoplay="true" data-glue-yt-video-height="99%" data-glue-yt-video-vid="oK8-jejegH8" data-glue-yt-video-width="100%" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=oK8-jejegH8" ng-cloak=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to help you make your move to the cloud.

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although summer is a time when many of us are thinking about sunshine and weekend trips to the beach, for retailers, summer means preparation for the holiday season, the most important sales period of the year. The typical holiday season presents retailers with familiar challenges: increased product demand, planning in-store seasonal staffing, supply chain pressures, and spikes in web traffic—to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 2020 is going to be different.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-tail impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to be felt in the retail industry through this year and into the next. Many retailers have been forced to reduce their physical footprints or change the way they operate, in addition to exploring new ways of delivering their products into the hands of customers, with more changes likely to come. Several major U.S. retailers have already announced being closed for Thanksgiving, further changing the digital and physical dynamics of the season. So how will this year’s holiday season play out?&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connecting people with information is what Google does best&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know the months ahead are paved with uncertainty, from fluctuating physical distancing restrictions, to questions on the strength of consumer spending given the pandemic, to the emergence of new consumer channels and buying paradigms. Retailers can prepare by understanding how shopper behaviors have changed, and by following the latest Google Cloud guidance in our ebook, “&lt;a href="https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/retail-bfcm-ebook-20/dl-cd.html?utm_content=content_hub&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=landingpage&amp;amp;pref=" target="_blank"&gt;A retailer’s guide to 2020 holiday season readiness: Five keys to success.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shape your strategy by understanding consumer behavior&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to the 2020 holiday season, third-party market trends and our Google-led research indicates three overarching consumer behaviors that have the power to affect how retailers perform. As your team prepares in the months ahead, keep in mind these changes to purchasing habits, loyalty, and sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. More consumers are shopping online for the first time, and for products they would normally buy in-store.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the shift to ecommerce accelerated &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/06/12/covid-19-accelerated-e-commerce-growth-4-to-6-years/#6f6e839a600f" target="_blank"&gt;at its fastest ever rate in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. By May, it was up 70% year-over-year and had reached &lt;a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/www/us/en/experience-cloud/digital-insights/pdfs/adobe_analytics-digital-economy-index-2020.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;$82.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. This shift affected retail segments that had previously lagged behind the shift online, like grocery. In the first week of March, only &lt;a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/what-grocery-retailers-can-learn-from-the-past-weeks" target="_blank"&gt;11% of US adults&lt;/a&gt; said they shopped online for groceries. By the end of the month, that figure had jumped to 37%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We saw the abandonment of long-established buying habits as home-bound customers began to experiment with new approaches to purchasing everyday items. In addition to the steep rise in online grocery shopping, 1 in 4 of surveyed shoppers went online during the lockdown to purchase something they would normally buy in-store.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While stores are now reopening in many regions, new limits on physical interactions, reluctance on the part of consumers to shop in-store due to fears around COVID-19 exposure, and the possibility of further store closures (due to future waves of the virus) mean that a question mark continues to hang over the viability of a predominantly bricks-and-mortar retail strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a flexible and scalable ecommerce channel is becoming table stakes as more consumers are willing to go online to find and purchase a wider variety of products. Retailers looking to prioritize their holiday season readiness efforts should begin by doubling down on their omnichannel strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Shoppers expect new contactless ways to make every type of purchase.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, many shoppers found a visit to a store to be the fastest and simplest way to get what they needed. That changed when lockdown and shelter-in-place orders were issued and 53% of shoppers reported trying a new shopping service for the first time.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This included grocery delivery, as previously mentioned, but also checking inventory online before heading to the store, as well as trying curbside pickup. And for those who haven’t yet tried new services, the intent is there. Searches for “&lt;a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/2020_covidretailguide_en-us.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;curbside pickup” rose 100% in March&lt;/a&gt;, while looking for “home delivery” grew by 70%—and more than 50% of consumers in a Google survey believe that curbside pick up will still be relevant as stores reopen.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What people are buying is also changing. Google Search data shows a drastic increase in searches for items to &lt;a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/coronavirus-consumer-behavior-research/" target="_blank"&gt;complement spending more time in the home&lt;/a&gt;. For example, ergonomic chairs to improve the home office or home improvement items to enhance the quality of living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers need to understand and be able to act on emerging consumer trends to deliver new offerings and support changing buying preferences. We recommend leveraging tools like &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/category-trends/us/month/en?" target="_blank"&gt;Rising Retail Categories&lt;/a&gt;to spot fast-rising retail categories, while investing in supply chain improvements to increase flexibility and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. With consumer sentiment low, shoppers are more value-conscious than ever before.&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread disruption to lives and livelihoods has contributed to a drop in consumer sentiment in many markets around the world. &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-global-view-of-how-consumer-behavior-is-changing-amid-covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;A McKinsey study&lt;/a&gt; found that the vast majority of consumers in the 45 countries surveyed expect COVID-19 to impact their finances and personal routines for more than two months. In the United States, almost a third of consumers are already switching to less expensive products to save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the retail industry as a whole, overall forecasts have decreased by more than 10% since the beginning of the year. Retailers that are successful this holiday season will have a strong, targeted strategy for reaching consumers with the products that are most relevant to them, at the right price.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching shoppers with the right message at the right time relies on having access to advanced analytics and machine learning technologies. With &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/retail#section-2"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt; solutions from Google Cloud like the recently launched &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/online-shopping-gets-personal-with-recommendations-ai"&gt;Recommendations AI,&lt;/a&gt; retailers can drive digital acceleration, increase consumer satisfaction and improve operational efficiency across the value chain.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here to help you prepare for the unpredictable&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year has been one of frantic and unexpected change for many of us. We’re committed to bringing forward technologies the retail industry needs and to partner with our customers to help them face any surprises this holiday season. This is why commerce companies such as &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0219/etsy-completes-migration"&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/customers/peak-performance-how-retailers-used-google-cloud-during-black-friday-cyber-monday"&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, and retailers like &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/featured/the-home-depot"&gt;The Home Depot&nbsp; and Urban Outfitters&lt;/a&gt; choose Google Cloud to support them during the busy shopping season. In particular, they leverage our Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM) white-glove services, where we work side-by-side with their IT and engineering teams from early capacity planning, to reliability tests, to operational war rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our teams are here with the solutions and the expertise to help you succeed through this holiday season and into the next.

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As COVID-19 turned our world into a more physically distant one, many people began looking to online video conferencing to maintain social, educational, and workplace contact. As shown in the graph below, this shift has driven huge numbers of additional users to Google Meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="continental peak session.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/continental_peak_session.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image__caption "&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The continental peak session count dictated how much serving capacity we needed to have available&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll share how we ensured that Meet’s available service capacity was ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/meet/bringing-google-meet-to-more-people/" target="_blank"&gt;its 30x COVID-19 usage growth&lt;/a&gt;, and how we made that growth technically and operationally sustainable by leveraging a number of &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-sre-teams-are-organized-and-how-to-get-started"&gt;site reliability engineering (SRE) best practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early alerts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world became more aware of COVID-19, people began to adapt their daily rhythms. The virus's growing impact on how people were working, learning, and socializing with friends and family translated to a lot more people looking to services like Google Meet to keep in touch. On Feb. 17, the Meet SRE team started receiving pages for regional capacity issues.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pages were &lt;i&gt;symptomatic&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/" target="_blank"&gt;black-box alerts&lt;/a&gt;, like “Too Many Task Failures” and “Too Much Load Being Shed.” Because Google's user-facing services are built with redundancy, these alerts didn’t indicate ongoing user-visible issues. But it soon became clear that usage of the product in Asia was trending sharply upward.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SRE team began working with the capacity planning team to find additional resources to handle this increase, but it became obvious that we needed to start planning farther ahead, for the eventuality that the epidemic would spread beyond the region.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, Italy began its COVID-19 lockdown soon thereafter, and usage of Meet in Italy began picking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A non-traditional incident&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we began formulating our response. True to form, the SRE team began by declaring an incident and kicking off our &lt;a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/incident-response/" target="_blank"&gt;incident response&lt;/a&gt; to this global capacity risk.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting, however, that while we approached this challenge using our tried-and-true incident management framework, at that point we were not in the middle of, or imminently about to have, an outage. There was no ongoing user impact. Most of the social effects of COVID-19 were unknown or very difficult to predict. Our mission was abstract: we needed to prevent any outages for what had become a critical product for large amounts of new users, while scaling the system without knowledge of where the growth would come from and when it would level off.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the entire team (along with the rest of Google) was in the process of transitioning into an indefinite period of working from home due to COVID-19. Even though most of our workflows and tools were &lt;a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43231/" target="_blank"&gt;already accessible from beyond our offices&lt;/a&gt;, there were additional challenges associated with running such a long-standing incident virtually.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the ability to sit in the same room as everyone else, it became important to manage communication channels proactively to ensure we all had access to the information needed to achieve our goals. Many of us also had additional, non-work related challenges, like looking after friends and family members as we all adjusted. While these factors created extra challenges for our response, tactics like assigning and ramping up standbys and proactively managing ownership and communication channels helped us overcome these challenges.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we carried on with our incident management approach. We started our global response by establishing an Incident Commander, Communications Lead, and Operations Lead in both North America and Europe so that we had around-the-clock coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the overall Incident Commanders, my function was like that of a stateful information router—albeit with opinions, influence, and decision-making power. I collected status information about which tactical problems lingered, who was working on what, and on the contexts that affected our response (e.g. governments’ COVID-19 responses), and then dispatched work to people who were able to help. By sniffing out and digging into areas of uncertainty (both in problem definition: “Is it a problem that we're running at 50% CPU utilization in South America?” and solution spaces: “How will we speed up our turn-up process?”), I coordinated our overall response effort and ensured that all necessary tasks had clear owners.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long into the response, we realized that the scope of our mission was huge and the nature of our response would be long-running. To keep each contributor’s scope manageable, we shaped our response into a number of semi-independent workstreams. In cases where their scopes overlapped, the interface between the workstreams was well-defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/how_we_scaled_google_meet.max-2800x2800.jpg" rel="external" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="how we scaled google meet.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/how_we_scaled_google_meet.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image__caption "&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click to enlarge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set up the following workstreams, visible in the diagram above:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Capacity&lt;/b&gt;, which was tasked with finding resources and determining how much of the service we could turn up in which places.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dependencies&lt;/b&gt;, which worked with the teams that own Meet’s infrastructure (e.g., Google’s account authentication and authorization systems) to ensure that these systems also had enough resources to scale with the usage growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bottlenecks&lt;/b&gt;, which was responsible for identifying and removing relevant scaling limits in our system.&nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Control knobs&lt;/b&gt;, which built new &lt;a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/spotlight-on-cloud/0636920347927" target="_blank"&gt;generic mitigations&lt;/a&gt; into the system in the case of an imminent or in-progress capacity outage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Production changes&lt;/b&gt;, which safely brought up all of the found capacity, re-deployed servers with newly-optimized tuning, and pushed new releases with additional control knobs ready to be used.&nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As incident responders, we continuously re-evaluated if our current operational structure still made sense. The goal was to have as much structure as required to operate effectively, but no more. With too little structure, people make decisions without having the right information, but with too much structure, people spend all of their time in planning meetings.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a marathon, and not a sprint. Throughout, we regularly checked in to see if anyone needed more help, or needed to take a break. This was essential in preventing burnout during such a long incident.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help prevent exhaustion, each person in an incident response role designated another as their “standby.” A standby attended the same meetings as the role’s primary responder; got access to all relevant documents, mailing lists, and chat rooms; and asked the questions they’d need answers to if they had to take over for the primary without much notice. This approach came in handy when any of our responders got sick or needed a break because their standby already had the information they needed to be effective right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building out our capacity runway&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the incident response team was figuring out how best to coordinate the flow of information and work needed to resolve this incident, most of those involved were actually addressing the risk in production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our primary technical requirement was simply to keep the amount of regionally available Meet service capacity ahead of user demand. With Google's &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/" target="_blank"&gt;more than 20 data centers&lt;/a&gt; operating around the world, we had robust infrastructure to tap into. We quickly made use of raw resources already available to us, which was enough to approximately double Meet’s available serving capacity.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, we relied on historical trends to establish how much more capacity we’d need to provision. But because we could no longer rely on the extrapolation of historical data, we needed to begin provisioning capacity based on predictive forecasts. To translate those models into terms our production changes team could act upon in production, the capacity workstream needed to translate the usage model into how much additional CPU and RAM we needed. Building this translation model is what later enabled us to speed up the process of getting available capacity in production, by teaching our tools and automation to understand it.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, it became clear that merely doubling our footprint size was not going to be enough, so we started working against a previously unthinkable 50x growth forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reducing resource needs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to scaling up our capacity, we also worked on identifying and removing inefficiencies in our serving stack. We could bucket much of this work into a couple of categories: tuning binary flags and resource allocations and rewriting code to make it cheaper to execute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making our server instances more resource-efficient was a multi-dimensional effort—the goal could be phrased as “the most requests handled at the cheapest resource cost, without sacrificing user experience or reliability of the system.”&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investigative questions we asked ourselves included:&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could we run fewer servers with larger resource reservations to reduce computational overhead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had we been reserving more RAM than we needed, or more CPU than we needed? Could we better use those resources for something else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did we have enough egress bandwidth at the edge of our network to serve video streams in all regions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could we reduce the amount of memory and CPU needed by a given server instance by &lt;a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/load-balancing-datacenter/" target="_blank"&gt;subsetting the number of backend servers&lt;/a&gt; in use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though we always qualified new server shapes and configurations, at this point, it was very much worth reevaluating them. As Meet usage grew, its usage characteristics—like how long a meeting lasts, the number of meeting participants, how participants share audio time—also shifted.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Meet service required ever more raw resources, we began noticing that a significant percentage of our CPU cycles were being spent on process overhead like keeping connections to monitoring systems and load balancers alive, rather than on request handling.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to increase the throughput, or “number of requests processed per CPU per second,” we increased our processes’ resource specification in terms of both CPU and RAM reservation. This is sometimes called running “fatter” tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="task improve cpu efficiency.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/task_improve_cpu_efficiency.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the example data above, you will notice two things: that all three of the instance specifications have the same computational overhead (in red), and that the larger the overall CPU reservation of an instance, the more request throughput it has (in yellow). With the same total amount of CPU allocated, one instance of the 4x shape can handle 1.8 times as many requests as the four instances with the baseline shape. This is because the computational overhead (like persisting debug log entries, checking if network connection channels are still alive, and initializing classes) doesn’t scale linearly with the number of incoming requests the task is handling.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We kept trying to double our serving tasks’ reservations while cutting in half the number of tasks across our fleet until we hit a scaling limitation.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we needed to test and qualify each of these changes. We used &lt;a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/canarying-releases/" target="_blank"&gt;canary environments&lt;/a&gt; to make sure that these changes behaved as expected and didn’t introduce or hit any previously undiscovered limitations. Similar to how we qualify new builds of our servers, we qualified that there weren’t any functional or performance regressions, and that the desired effects of the changes were indeed realized in production.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also made functional improvements to our codebase. For example, we rewrote an in-memory distributed cache to be more flexible in how it sharded entries across task instances. This, in turn, let us store more entries in a single region when we grew the number of server instances in a cluster.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Crafting fire escapes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though our confidence in our usage growth forecasts was improving, these predictions were still not 100% reliable. What would happen if we ran out of serving capacity in a region? What would happen if we saturated a particular network link? The control knob workstream’s goal was to provide satisfactory, if not ideal, answers to those kinds of questions. We needed an acceptable plan for any &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory" target="_blank"&gt;black swans&lt;/a&gt; that arrived on our consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group began working to identify and build more production controls and &lt;a href="http://noidea.dog/fires" target="_blank"&gt;fire escapes&lt;/a&gt;—all of which we hoped we wouldn't need. For example, these knobs would allow us to quickly downgrade the default video resolution from high-definition to standard-definition when someone joined a Meet conference. That change would buy us some time to course-correct using the other workstreams (provisioning and efficiency improvements) without substantial product degradation, but users would still be able to upgrade their video quality to high-definition if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a variety of instrumented controls like this built, tested, and ready to go bought us some additional runway if our worst-case forecasts weren’t accurate—along with some peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Operational sustainability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This structured response involved large numbers of Googlers in a variety of roles. This meant that to keep making progress throughout the incident, we also needed some serious coordination and intentional communications.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We held daily handover meetings between our two time zones to accommodate Googlers based in Zurich, Stockholm, Kirkland, Wash., and Sunnyvale, Calif. Our communications leads provided regular updates to numerous stakeholders across our product team, executives, infrastructure teams, and customer support operations so that each team had up-to-date status information when they made their own decisions. The workstream leads used Google Docs to keep shared status documents updated with current sets of risks, points of contact, ongoing mitigation efforts, and meeting notes.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach worked well enough to get things going, but soon began to feel burdensome. We needed to lengthen our planning cycle from days to weeks in order to meaningfully reduce the amount of time spent coordinating, and increase the time we spent actually mitigating our crisis.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our first tactic here was to build better and more trustworthy forecasting models. This increased predictability meant we could stabilize our target increase in serving capacity for the whole week, rather than just for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also worked to reduce &lt;a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/" target="_blank"&gt;the amount of toil&lt;/a&gt; necessary to bring up any additional serving capacity. Our processes, just like the systems we operate, needed to be automated.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, scaling Meet’s serving stack was our most work-intensive ongoing operation, due to the number of people who needed to be up-to-date on the latest forecast and resource numbers, and the number of (sometimes flaky) tools involved in certain operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="scaling google meet.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/scaling_google_meet.0999031219990282.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As outlined in the life-cycle diagram above, the trick to automating these tasks was incremental improvements. First we documented tasks, and then we began automating pieces of them until finally, in the ideal case, the software could complete the task from start to finish without manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, we committed a number of automation experts from within and outside the Meet organization to focus on tackling this problem space. Some of the work items here included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making more of our production services responsive to changes in an authoritative, checked-in configuration file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Augmenting common tools to support some of Meet’s more unique system requirements (e.g., its higher bandwidth and lower latency networking requirements)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuning regression checks that had become more flaky as the system grew in scale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automating and codifying these tasks made a significant dent in the manual operations required to turn up Meet in a new cluster or to deploy a new binary version that would unlock performance improvements. By the end of this scaling incident, we were able to fully automate our per-zone, per-serving job capacity footprint, which precluded hundreds of manually constructed invocations of command-line tools. This freed up time and energy for more than a few engineers to work on some of the more difficult (but equally important) problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in scaling our operations, we could move to “offline” handoffs between sites via email, further reducing the number of meetings to attend. Now that our strategy was solidified and our runway was longer, we moved into a more purely tactical mode of execution.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, we wound down our incident structure and began to operate the remaining work more like how we'd run any long-term project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time we exited our incident, Meet had more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240434/google-meet-three-million-users-per-day-pichai-earnings" target="_blank"&gt;100 million daily meeting participants&lt;/a&gt;. Getting there smoothly was not easy or straightforward; the scenarios the Meet team explored during &lt;a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/lessons-learned/" target="_blank"&gt;disaster and incident response tests&lt;/a&gt; prior to COVID-19 did not encompass the length or the scale of increased capacity requirements we encountered. As a result, we formulated much of our response on the fly.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of hiccups along the way, as we had to balance risk in a different way than we normally do during standard operations. For example, we deployed new server code to production with less canary baking time than normal because it contained some performance fixes that bought us additional time before we were due to run out of available regional capacity.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most crucial skills we honed throughout this two month-long endeavour was the ability to catalog, quantify, and qualify risks and payoffs in a way that was flexible. Everyday, we learned new information about COVID-19 lockdowns, new customers’ plans to start using Meet, and available production capacity. Sometimes this new information made obsolete the work we’d started the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time was of the essence, so we couldn’t afford to treat each work item with the same priority or urgency, but we also couldn’t afford not to hedge our own forecast models. Waiting for perfect information wasn’t an option at any point, so the best we could do was build out our runway as much as possible, while making calculated but quick decisions with the data we did have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this work was only possible because of the savvy, collaborative, and versatile people across a dozen teams and as many functions—SREs, developers, product managers, program managers, network engineers, and customer support—who worked together to make this happen.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ended up well-positioned for what came next: making Meet available for free to &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/meet/bringing-google-meet-to-more-people/" target="_blank"&gt;everyone&lt;/a&gt; with a Google account. Normally, opening the product up to consumers would have been a dramatic scaling event all on its own, but after the intense scaling work we'd already done, we were ready for the next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;APIs are a critical component of any enterprise’s digital transformation strategy. They can drive customer engagement, accelerate time to market of new services, power innovation and unlock new business opportunities. Therefore, choosing the right API management platform is critical to running a successful API program, and research from industry analyst firms like Forrester Research can help enterprises evaluate and choose the right solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re proud to share that Google Cloud has been recognized by Forrester as a leader in The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q3 2020.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe this recognition is a testament to our continued strategic investments in product innovation and laser-sharp focus on the success of our customers. Today, six of the top 10 healthcare companies, seven of the top 10 retailers, five of the top 10 financial services companies and six of the top 10 telecom providers trust Apigee to drive their digital transformation efforts. Moreover, many global organizations that were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic continued to invest in Apigee as they doubled-down on their digital strategy.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this report, Forrester assessed 15 API management solutions against a set of pre-defined criteria. In addition to being named a leader, Google Cloud received the highest possible score in the &lt;i&gt;market presence category, and the strategy category criteria of product vision, and planned enhancements, and current offering criteria such as API user engagement, REST API documentation, formal lifecycle management, data validation and attack protection, API product management, and analytics and reporting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a long-standing player in the market, Google Cloud has rich resources for educating customers and prospects on API business potential, including using them to create new ecosystem models. This shows in the product’s rich set of API product and pricing definition features,” according to the Forrester report.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrester also noted that Google Cloud has deepened its integration of Apigee with other Google Cloud capabilities such as reCAPTCHA, machine learning and Istio-based service mesh. Forrester also noted that Google Cloud’s reference customers expressed high satisfaction with Apigee API management.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe this reflects why large global brands like Nationwide Insurance, Philips, Pizza Hut, ABN Amro, Ticketmaster and Change Healthcare etc. partner with Google Cloud to drive their digital transformation programs.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I've really appreciated about Apigee isn't just the functionality in the developer portal, but the guidance they provided on how we should roll out our API strategy and how we can think strategically about digital transformation using APIs," said Rick Schnierer, AVP, One IT Applications Business Solutions, Nationwide Insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can download the full The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q3 2020 report &lt;a href="https://pages.apigee.com/forrester-wave-2020-register/?int_source=website&amp;amp;int_medium=blog&amp;amp;int_campaign=2020-Forrester-Wave" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (requires an email address).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Apigee, visit the website &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/apigee/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since joining Google a few months ago to lead G Suite marketing, I’ve been humbled by the many inspiring stories of businesses reacting swiftly to the global pandemic. Our customers have enabled their teams to re-imagine not only how they communicate and collaborate with each other remotely, but also how they continue to serve their own customers and support the communities they belong to. From doctors consulting with patients, to financial institutions providing critical advice to customers, to teachers delivering distant learning, to car dealerships creating virtual showrooms with G Suite—it’s clear that these new ways of working are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the inspirational stories I’ve heard from our customers.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keeping teams connected and productive&nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activision Blizzard King (ABK)&lt;/b&gt;, a leading interactive entertainment company, is going all in with G Suite. Working with SADA, a Google Cloud Premier Partner, Activision Blizzard was looking for an innovative and scalable solution to transform the way their teams work together. As their developers around the world build the next generation of innovation in gaming, they rely on the power of collaboration in G Suite to create, connect, and share with each other. G Suite helps them successfully meet critical deadlines for game launches and updates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The safety of our teams is paramount during these disruptive times, and our workforce is already widely distributed across multiple locations internationally. G Suite has brought our teams together as we continue to collaborate while we’re apart,” says Jacques Erasmus, Chief Information Officer, Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PwC&lt;/b&gt;, a global professional services organization, enabled over 275,000 people to work from home in response to COVID-19. G Suite enables PwC to not only collaborate and stay connected with each other, but to continue to serve their clients in a timely and efficient manner. As a global organization with most of its people around the world needing to work from home, PwC reached nearly 10 million hours of video conferencing in Google Meet in a single month.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"G Suite allows us to stay connected—it's the single place where we can collaborate, discuss, and share work, in the current situation,” says Hilda Clune, Technology and Transformation Leader at PwC. "G Suite provides enough resilience and security, and the ability to scale at the speed we need to." Learn about how PwC works remotely with G Suite:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-video"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module article-video "&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="h-c-video h-c-video--marquee" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile="true" data-glue-modal-trigger="uni-modal-rlgyiRoBGhk-" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rlgyiRoBGhk"&gt;&lt;img alt="PwC transformed the way they work with G Suite. Now they collaborate and communicate effectively across 170 locations around the world." src="//img.youtube.com/vi/rlgyiRoBGhk/maxresdefault.jpg"/&gt;&lt;svg class="h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white" role="img"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#mi-youtube-icon"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-modal--video" data-glue-modal="uni-modal-rlgyiRoBGhk-" data-glue-modal-close-label="Close Dialog"&gt;&lt;a class="glue-yt-video" data-glue-yt-video-autoplay="true" data-glue-yt-video-height="99%" data-glue-yt-video-vid="rlgyiRoBGhk" data-glue-yt-video-width="100%" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rlgyiRoBGhk" ng-cloak=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kärcher&lt;/b&gt;, a global manufacturer of cleaning equipment, accelerated its plans to move its 14,000 workers to G Suite in response to COVID-19. They accomplished the transition in only five days, enabling employees to collaborate effectively without being physically present in a Kärcher office. G Suite plays a critical role as Kaercher resumes business globally in the post-COVID phase, user adoption of various G Suite apps continues to grow, and management is using tools like Jamboards and Google Meet hardware to help them collaborate better and stay connected with their teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With G Suite, Kaercher has transformed its global collaboration, allowing for faster business decisions during the COVID-19 crisis,” says Dr. Daniel Heubach, Chief Information Officer of Kaercher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To face the current health crisis, &lt;b&gt;De’Longhi&lt;/b&gt;, an appliance manufacturer based in Italy, created a local and international taskforce to ensure all their employees have everything they need to work from home safely and effectively. G Suite is playing a critical role in helping them achieve this goal. The De’Longhi taskforce uses Google Sheets to help them collect up-to-date information from each of their regions, and connect with local teams via Google Meet to better understand the unique circumstances and challenges they’re facing. As teams began to work from home with G Suite, De’Longhi has seen a 500% increase in Meet usage and a 200% growth in the number of shared files in Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Helping to provide communities with critical services&nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Louis-based &lt;b&gt;Schnucks&lt;/b&gt; evolved from a neighborhood grocery chain to essential workers—virtually overnight. They supported both corporate and frontline workers in stores with an information hotline and created a virtual dispatch center for their transportation team, all through Google Meet. See how Schnucks was able to keep providing groceries to the communities it serves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-video"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module article-video "&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="h-c-video h-c-video--marquee" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile="true" data-glue-modal-trigger="uni-modal-uTuOGwotfGk-" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uTuOGwotfGk"&gt;&lt;img alt='"St. Louis-based Schnucks had to go from neighborhood grocery chain to essential workers overnight.

Thanks to Google Meet, CHA was able to continue serving these patients in a timely manner. Outpatient Psychiatry was an early adopter of video visits, which are more appropriate for behavioral health care than phone consultations. Between March and June 2020, CHA was able to maintain 90% of its expected patient visit volume in Psychiatry, a huge win for patients, families, and the communities CHA serves.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Southern Cross Care (SA, NT &amp;amp; VIC) Inc&lt;/b&gt; has begun using Google Meet to help residents across their 17 Residential Aged Care homes stay connected to their loved ones, despite lockdown measures associated with COVID-19. Residents can now also see their doctor virtually via Google Meet, keeping them safe from any potential exposure to the virus while still experiencing a high level of care through these virtual consultations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enabling business services for customers, no matter where they are&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italian bank &lt;b&gt;Credem (Credito Emiliano S.p.A)&lt;/b&gt;, relies on G Suite to help their staff adapt to a collaborative work-from-home environment leveraging tools like Google Meet, Drive and Docs. G Suite enables their teams across its banking and insurance businesses to collaborate and stay connected while working remotely. Credem has also created a “virtual branch” by moving its customer support to video conferencing using Google Meet. This enables customers to continue to get access to critical financial services, remotely and safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;KIA Motors&lt;/b&gt;, a multinational automotive manufacturer, is using G Suite to provide "virtual viewings" for its customers, enabling them to continue to engage in an immersive and engaging car-buying experience. With Google Meet, KIA's sellers can interact with customers, provide them with a virtual demonstration of a car, and answer any questions that come up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Live Stream Showroom demonstrates our continued commitment to tailor the car-buying journey to the demands of our customers with virtual viewings,” says JT Hong, Head of Global Channel &amp;amp; Service department at Kia Motors. “By launching this new platform testing in the Middle East &amp;amp; Africa region, we aim to stay ahead of the curve in digital sales and marketing in this time of transition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just a few recent examples of how G Suite helps customers not only adapt to the current situation, but also reimagine how to get things done. We’ve been working hard to make &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/introducing-your-new-home-for-work-in-gsuite"&gt;G Suite a better home for your work&lt;/a&gt; by providing an integrated workspace that brings together the core elements of work—like chat, email, voice, video, and tasks—and making them better together. Our goal is to help teams to stay productive and connected, no matter where they’re working from, and enable businesses to serve their customers safely and more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-related_article_tout"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout h-c-page"&gt;&lt;section class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;a class="uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker" data-analytics='{ "event": "page interaction", "category": "article lead", "action": "related article - inline", "label": "article: {slug}" }' href="https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/g-suite/helping-businesses-and-schools-stay-connected-in-response-to-coronavirus/"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow"&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image" style="background-image: url('')"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content"&gt;&lt;h4 class="uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin"&gt;Helping businesses and schools stay connected in response to Coronavirus&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__body"&gt;We’re rolling out free access to video-conferencing tools to help businesses and educators connect no matter where they’re located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted"&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class="icon h-c-icon" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#mi-arrow-forward" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

   <title>Week 1 recap of Google Cloud Next ‘20: OnAir</title>

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Next ’20: OnAir kicked off this week, and we couldn’t be more excited. From inspiring words from &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=GENKEY01#industry-insights" target="_blank"&gt;Google and Alphabet CEO, Sundar Pichai&lt;/a&gt;, to a deep dive into the future of cloud with Thomas Kurian, to dozens of industry-specific breakout sessions, this week set the tone for what’s to come during our &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/" target="_blank"&gt;nine-week series&lt;/a&gt;, with plenty of resources to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spotlight on customers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re continually inspired by the ways Google Cloud customers are growing and transforming in the cloud. Here are just a few of the Google Cloud customer stories we’ve recently shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0706/deutsche-bank-and-google"&gt;Deutsche Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0714/fox-sports-teams-up-with-google-cloud"&gt;FOX Sports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0714/google-cloud-procter-gamble-consumers"&gt;Procter &amp;amp; Gamble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com//press-releases/2020/0709/groupe-renault-and-google-cloud"&gt;Group Renault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0611/google-cloud-telefonica-partnership"&gt;Telefónica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0713/vz-google-announcement"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsZq6_wZAHM" target="_blank"&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDeCD0k6fQs" target="_blank"&gt;Carrefour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlUo5qP5AWc" target="_blank"&gt;Humana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55xgR_o4PGs" target="_blank"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also heard directly from our innovative customers and partners during our&lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions#industry-insights" target="_blank"&gt;industry keynotes&lt;/a&gt;, including MLB, Lowe’s, Capital One, Activision Blizzard King, New York State Department of Labor, Mayo Clinic Platform and Groupe Renault who each shared stories about how Google Cloud is helping them adapt to the current environment.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key announcements from the week&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, kicked off Next OnAir with &lt;b&gt;an overview of Google Cloud’s strategy&lt;/b&gt; and how we’re helping businesses grow and transform digitally. Read &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/how-businesses-can-transform-digitally-with-google-cloud"&gt;Thomas’ blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/81y2EEjllcI" target="_blank"&gt;watch the keynote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data is a critical component of decision making across organizations, but is often scattered across multiple public clouds, resulting in a fragmented user experience, multiple copies of data across different environments, siloed IT and varying levels of access and controls needed. This week we announced &lt;b&gt;BigQuery Omni&lt;/b&gt;, a flexible, multi-cloud analytics solution that allows you to&nbsp; cost-effectively access and securely analyze data across Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure (coming soon), without leaving the familiar BigQuery user interface. BigQuery Omni is powered by Anthos, and is an extension of our continued innovation and commitment to multi-cloud. BigQuery Omni is currently in private alpha. Learn more in our &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-bigquery-omni"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, or read our recent Forbes BrandVoice piece on &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/googlecloud/2020/07/16/how-computing-has-evolved-and-why-multi-cloud-is-the-future/#3c4dad493d66" target="_blank"&gt;the future of multi-cloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Google, we believe the future of cloud computing will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services that give users confidence that they are always in control over the confidentiality of their data. To complement our encryption in-transit and at-rest, Google Cloud will now offer the ability to encrypt data in use—while it’s being processed. This is called Confidential Computing and our first product in this space, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confidential VMs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now in beta. Learn more in our &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-google-cloud-confidential-computing-with-confidential-vms"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As US government agencies, and the enterprises that serve them, adopt cloud technologies, security and compliance requirements around data locality and personnel access are key considerations. Many cloud providers have built separate environments to run government workloads, requiring users to operate two distinct application and operation supply chains. To provide a better way, this week we announced &lt;b&gt;Assured Workloads for Government&lt;/b&gt; (private beta) to help you serve government workloads without the compromises of traditional “government clouds.” Learn more in our &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/assured-workloads-for-government-compliance-without-compromise"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; or read our recent &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/googlecloud/2020/07/14/compliance-without-compromise/#5a00934f17cd" target="_blank"&gt;Forbes BrandVoice article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for flexible work has increased the volume of demands on everyone’s time, and many of us want the tools we already use to be even more helpful. That’s why we introduced&lt;a href="http://g.co/cloud/innovating-gsuite" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;a better home for work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;in G Suite&lt;/b&gt; that integrates core tools like video, chat, email, files, and tasks. This makes them &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; together, so you can stay on top of things from anywhere. Learn more in our blog post, or check out G Suite Vice President and General Manager Javier Soltero’s &lt;a href="http://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=SOLKEY101" target="_blank"&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt;, available on demand starting next Tuesday, July 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas’s keynote also included recaps of key announcements made in the past month including &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/high-performance-cloud-file-storage"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Filestore High Scale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (beta), &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/google-cloud-vmware-engine-is-generally-available"&gt;Cloud VMware Engine&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;(GA), &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/active-assist-comes-to-google-cloud"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Active Assist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-data-qna"&gt;Data QnA&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;(alpha), and our &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/bare-metal-solution-comes-to-five-new-google-cloud-regions"&gt;&lt;b&gt;expansion of Bare Metal Solution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in five more regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our partners play a critical role in supporting the needs of our customers. At our Partners Summit this week, we announced &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/partners/differentiate-yourself-as-a-google-cloud-partner-and-grow-your-customer-base"&gt;&lt;b&gt;updates to our Partner Advantage program&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which helps partners differentiate themselves through certification, expertise, and specialization. We also announced the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/partners/introducing-the-google-cloud-isv-saas-center-of-excellence"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Google Cloud ISV/SaaS Center of Excellence (CoE)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new resource to help independent software vendor (ISVs) transform their applications with open, cloud-agnostic architectures, improve user experience through AI/ML and voice, and deliver intelligent insights from their applications by providing rich analytics to business users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry-focused demos to help you get hands-on with the cloud&nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our broader Next OnAir program, we also launched 18 industry-focused demos this week, where attendees could explore &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/demos?demo=115" target="_blank"&gt;AI/ML for manufacturing use cases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/demos?demo=116" target="_blank"&gt;how to fuel growth with retail market insights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/demos?demo=103" target="_blank"&gt;how to transform customer service with Contact Center AI&lt;/a&gt;, and more.

   <title>Introducing your new home for work in G Suite</title>

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual meetings, remote collaboration, flexible hours: it’s becoming clear that these new ways of working are here to stay. In my conversations with customers and business leaders since the onset of COVID-19, I’ve seen workplace transformation go from an almost theoretical long-term goal to an urgent priority. Employers and &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2018/06/96-of-u-s-professionals-say-they-need-flexibility-but-only-47-have-it" target="_blank"&gt;workers want&lt;/a&gt; more flexible ways of working, and delivering on this requires the right technology.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But flexibility isn’t the only thing that workers want. Remote working has significantly increased the demands we’re getting from many directions—in both our professional and our personal lives. People tell us they feel overloaded with too much information and too many tasks across too many different tools. Instead of learning another tool, we need the tools we already use to be even more helpful, and work together, in an integrated, intuitive way.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why today, we’re introducing &lt;a href="http://g.co/cloud/innovating-gsuite" target="_blank"&gt;a better home for work&lt;/a&gt;. G Suite now intelligently brings together the people, content, and tasks you need to make the most of your time. &lt;b&gt;We’re integrating core tools like video, chat, email, files, and tasks, and making them better together, so that you can more easily stay on top of things, from anywhere.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-video"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module article-video "&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="h-c-video h-c-video--marquee" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile="true" data-glue-modal-trigger="uni-modal-4Cslvqi38eI-" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4Cslvqi38eI"&gt;&lt;img alt="See our first step toward making G Suite a more seamless and integrated workspace. This new product experience intelligently brings together core tools like video, chat, email, files and tasks—right in Gmail—so that you can make the most of your time at work. If you’d like to try this new integrated workspace out yourself, you can sign up here: g.co/cloud/innovating-gsuite. We’ll be expanding availability to more customers over the following weeks, and you’ll be notified when it’s ready for you to try." src="//img.youtube.com/vi/4Cslvqi38eI/maxresdefault.jpg"/&gt;&lt;svg class="h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white" role="img"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#mi-youtube-icon"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-modal--video" data-glue-modal="uni-modal-4Cslvqi38eI-" data-glue-modal-close-label="Close Dialog"&gt;&lt;a class="glue-yt-video" data-glue-yt-video-autoplay="true" data-glue-yt-video-height="99%" data-glue-yt-video-vid="4Cslvqi38eI" data-glue-yt-video-width="100%" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4Cslvqi38eI" ng-cloak=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers like Colgate-Palmolive and ATB Financial, who’ve previewed the new product experience, are giving us great feedback about this integrated workspace. Gene Molloy, VP IT End User Technology at Iron Mountain, said it “seamlessly brings together the best of G Suite to make us more efficient with less context switching, allowing us to focus on the task at hand with fewer distractions.”&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bringing things together&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we looked at ways to deepen the integration between email, chat, and video—three core pillars of communication—we started where most of us begin our workday: our inbox. To easily &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/stay-connected-more-easily-with-meet-in-gmail-on-mobile/" target="_blank"&gt;join video meetings straight from your inbox&lt;/a&gt;, we brought Meet into Gmail on the web, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/stay-connected-more-easily-with-meet-in-gmail-on-mobile/" target="_blank"&gt;Android, and iOS&lt;/a&gt;—and &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/meet/bringing-google-meet-to-more-people/" target="_blank"&gt;made it free for everyone&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/06/migrate-your-users-from-classic-hangouts-to-chat.html" target="_blank"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, we brought Google Chat into Gmail on web to help you communicate more seamlessly, without the disruption of switching tabs. Soon, Chat will join Gmail on Android and iOS, making it even easier to do more from one place, wherever you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "&gt;&lt;img alt="1 Meet in Gmail.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_Meet_in_Gmail.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also enhancing the collaboration features in Chat rooms by adding shared files and tasks, making rooms an even better solution for longer-term projects. With quick access to shared chat, important documents, and to-dos in one place, it’s easier for everyone in a group to stay on the same page. Plus, Chat lets you create rooms that include people outside your company, like contractors or consultants, so your group can be not only cross-functional but also cross-organizational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="2 chat rooms.gif" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/Task.gif"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make rooms even more useful, we’ve infused them with real-time collaboration by adding the ability to open and co-edit a document with your team without leaving Gmail. This makes it easier for you to collaborate directly within the context of where you’re doing your work in the moment—so, for example, you can chat about the changes you’re making to a document in real time, or assign a new task (or mark one complete!), without switching between screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="3 docs side-by-side.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/3_docs_side-by-side.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new integrated workspace also makes it easy to access your favorite third-party apps, including DocuSign, Salesforce, and Trello, so you can get updates and take action within any kind of conversation—across Gmail, Chat, and rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "&gt;&lt;img alt="4 integrated workspace.gif" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/4_integrated_workspace.gif"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Making things better together&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing we’ve heard again and again from our users is how switching between apps interrupts their flow—and their focus. That’s why in this new integrated experience, we’ve been thoughtful about how to help you work more fluidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few examples: you can quickly join a video call from a chat, forward a chat message to your inbox, create a task from a chat message—everything connects together in a way that makes it easy for you to manage the flow of your work and get more done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "&gt;&lt;img alt="5 video chat.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/5_video_chat.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, because quickly finding what you need is paramount to productivity, we’ve also expanded Gmail’s powerful search capability to include Chat, so it’s easier to find everything in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="Mail Search.gif" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/search.gif"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lastly, we’re introducing several tools to help you prioritize and stay focused. You can now:&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pin important rooms so they’re easier to find and access&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set your availability to “Do Not Disturb”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better protect your time with status notices like “Out of office”&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to try this new integrated workspace out yourself, you can &lt;a href="http://g.co/cloud/innovating-gsuite" target="_blank"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be expanding availability to more customers over the following weeks, and you’ll be notified when it’s ready for you to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enhanced security for Meet and Chat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For flexible work models to succeed, organizations must continue to maintain security and compliance for their users and data. More than 6 million businesses trust and rely on G Suite to protect their most sensitive data. Today, we’re also announcing several new security features for Meet and Chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, we will be rolling out new security capabilities for Google Meet that give hosts even more control over meetings, such as who can join or collaborate within them. Starting with consumer and G Suite for Education customers, these features will include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knocking controls:&lt;/b&gt; Once an attendee is ejected, they won't be able to attempt to join the same meeting again by knocking, unless the host re-invites them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Safety locks:&lt;/b&gt; Hosts can now decide which attendees can chat or present in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we’ll be extending the strong phishing protections that we’ve built within Gmail to Google Chat. For example, if a user clicks on a link in Chat, it will be scanned in real-time and flagged if it’s found to contain malicious content. Get all the details about the latest G Suite security features &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/gsuite-security-updates-for-gmail-meet-chat-and-admin"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="6 enhanced security.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/6_enhanced_security.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More on the way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication and collaboration are about connecting people, and we’re always looking for ways to better integrate our products to help everyone work better, together. Some of the recent improvements we’ve rolled out include letting you &lt;a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/11/dynamic-mail-android-ios.html" target="_blank"&gt;respond to document comments or action items directly from your inbox on mobile&lt;/a&gt;, helping you connect and analyze data across the organization with &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/connected-sheets-is-generally-available"&gt;Connected Sheets&lt;/a&gt;, and introducing new &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=PC112&amp;amp;gate=true#industry-insights" target="_blank"&gt;collaboration capabilities in our hardware offerings&lt;/a&gt;. (You can learn more about these and other new features in &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions#productivity-collaboration" target="_blank"&gt;our sessions&lt;/a&gt; at Google Cloud Next ’20: OnAir.)&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, you’ll see our integrated workspace expand even further—with features like picture-in-picture video calls right in Gmail; the integration of Google Meet into our content tools like Docs, Sheets, and Slides; and more. Our goal is to provide an intelligent and seamless solution that gives everyone the ability to make a real impact, and the flexibility to work exactly where and how they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="b02.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/b02.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, I’m excited to help more companies make the transition to flexible work with G Suite. I still remember my first few weeks at Google—how amazed I was that Smart Compose effortlessly completed my sentences, even as I switched between English and Spanish; or that Slides not only enabled, but suggested that I present directly from my phone to a meeting (and it worked!). The features that once surprised and delighted me have now become table-stakes capabilities I can’t live without. Work is more seamless, flexible, and productive than I could’ve imagined. And that’s the way it should be for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-related_article_tout"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout h-c-page"&gt;&lt;section class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;a class="uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker" data-analytics='{ "event": "page interaction", "category": "article lead", "action": "related article - inline", "label": "article: {slug}" }' href="https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/g-suite/gsuite-security-updates-for-gmail-meet-chat-and-admin/"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow"&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image" style="background-image: url('https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/g_suite_security.0999041419990829.max-500x500.jpg')"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content"&gt;&lt;h4 class="uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin"&gt;Safety first: Announcing 11 new G Suite security features&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__body"&gt;New updates in G Suite provide even stronger security around our key products: Gmail, Meet, Chat, and Admin.

Last year, we launched the Google Cloud Partner Advantage program to help them do exactly that. Since then, we’ve added new certifications,&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/partners/specializations/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;expanded &lt;a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/crn-exclusive-new-google-cloud-partner-advantage-program-launches-today?itc=refresh" target="_blank"&gt;our Expertise areas to cover new priority solutions&lt;/a&gt;, and added &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/partners/specializations/"&gt;new specializations&lt;/a&gt;. According to our &lt;a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/the_google_cloud_partner_opportunity.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;most recent Forrester study&lt;/a&gt;, certification, expertise, and specializations are three of the top areas partners talk about when it comes to growing their business—and it’s why all three play a key role in our program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/part_advantage_differentiation_journey.max-2800x2800.jpg" rel="external" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="part advantage differentiation journey.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/part_advantage_differentiation_journey.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image__caption "&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click to enlarge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we look ahead to the second half of 2020, we wanted to share updates to the Partner Advantage program across several core areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Certifications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Recognition as a certified professional on Google Cloud or G Suite is the first major step an individual can take to demonstrate their level of skill and knowledge on Google Cloud. We offer several learning and training opportunities of which you can take advantage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/certifications/interest.html" target="_blank"&gt;certification interest form&lt;/a&gt; to get started on certifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take proctored exams online or at a local testing center. &lt;a href="https://webassessor.com/wa.do?page=publicHome&amp;amp;branding=GOOGLECLOUD" target="_blank"&gt;Click here to register&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider learning opportunities such as &lt;a href="https://partneronair.withgoogle.com/events/partner-certification-kickstart-professional-cloud-architect-english" target="_blank"&gt;Partner Certification Kickstart (PCK) programs&lt;/a&gt; that allow you to take accelerated, self-paced courses and hands-on training in six weeks or less. &lt;a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/partner-certification-kickstart-pck-sprint/" target="_blank"&gt;PCK Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, enables technical partners on GCP products through a mix of virtual classes, SME sessions and CloudHero games. Or &lt;a href="http://googlecourses.qwiklabs.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Google Courses powered by Qwiklabs&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a central location for on demand training and hands on labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join upcoming webinars, such as the “&lt;a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/technical-why-certify-now/registrations/rsvp/#current-step" target="_blank"&gt;Why Certify Now?&lt;/a&gt;” webcast on Wednesday, August 5. We're also launching the Professional Machine Learning Engineer certification in October, so you can also register to learn more about the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification/machine-learning-engineer" target="_blank"&gt;Professional Machine Learning Engineer&lt;/a&gt; certification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer success&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Customer success is the driving force behind a partner’s entire differentiation journey. Highlighting your customer wins and showcasing what you do in the market along the way builds credibility. Customer success stories also help you meet eligibility requirements for Expertise (one public story required) and Specialization (at least three required).&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help you easily share your customer wins, we’ve introduced a new customer success story tool to accelerate and simplify highlighting your phenomenal stories—find it &lt;a href="https://www.partneradvantage.goog/GCPPRM/s/prm-customer-case-study/PRM_Customer_Case_Study__c/Default" target="_blank"&gt;on the Partner Advantage portal&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can find a wealth of partner customer showcases on the &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners" target="_blank"&gt;Google Cloud Partner Directory&lt;/a&gt;, here are a few of the many great examples of customer success from our partners:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/mondelez/"&gt;Mondelēz and MightyHive: Personalizing CPG sales and marketing on a global scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/dxterity/"&gt;DxTerity and Pluto7: Using data-driven precision medicine to combat autoimmune disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/mitsubishi-motors"&gt;Mitsubishi Motors and Aeris Communications: Fueling customer engagement with the connected car&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expertise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Partner Expertise demonstrates your early customer success at a more granular level across products, priority solutions, and/or industries segments, based on a defined set of requirements, including customer evidence. All partners are welcome to apply for Partner Expertise, no matter the business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Expertise areas for which Partners can apply&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Meet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainframe Modernization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Google Cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migrate Oracle Workloads to Google Cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our partners continue to showcase their commitment via Expertise in solutions and industries&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NORTHAM&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=maven-wave&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Maven Wave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=pluto7-consulting-inc&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Pluto7 Consulting Inc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=softserve&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Softserve Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=springml&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;SpringML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EMEA&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=ancoris&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Ancoris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=cloudreach&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Cloudreach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=fourcast&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Fourcast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=pa-consulting-group&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;PA Consulting Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;APAC&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=cloud-comrade-pte-ltd&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud Comrade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=cloud-mile-limited&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;CloudMile Limited&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=pluto-seven-business-solutions-private-limited&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Pluto Seven Business Solutions Private Limited&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=searce&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Searce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LATAM&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=colaborativa&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Colaborativa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=dedalus-prime&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Dedalus Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=qi-network&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Qi Network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=safetec-inform%C3%A1tica&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Safetec Informatica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JAPAN&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=cloud-ace-inc&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud Ace, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=%E6%A0%AA%E5%BC%8F%E4%BC%9A%E7%A4%BE%E3%82%A8%E3%83%8B%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B9&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Enisias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Specialization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/partners/specializations/"&gt;Partner Specialization&lt;/a&gt; remains the highest level of achievement within the partner journey.

machine learning—how we're supporting organizations throughout their AI journey with tools and solutions that can fundamentally transform businesses.&nbsp;For a more detailed look at the week, read&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/what-happened-week8-of-google-cloud-next20-onair"&gt;An AI gold mine: What happened at Google Cloud Next ‘20 OnAir.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operationalizing machine learning workflows is critical to building repeatable, scalable processes. To improve the &lt;b&gt;MLOps&lt;/b&gt; experience, we pre-announced: Prediction backend GA, Managed Pipelines, Metadata, Experiments, and Model Evaluation. These features—part of&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform"&gt;AI Platform&lt;/a&gt;—provide automation and monitoring at all steps of ML system construction, including integration, testing, releasing, deployment and infrastructure management. Read more about MLOps in&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/key-requirements-for-an-mlops-foundation"&gt;Key requirements for an MLOps foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coming soon: AI Platform will include &lt;b&gt;AutoML&lt;/b&gt; as an integrated function in the workflow. This combines the best of no-code and code-based options to build custom ML models faster and with higher quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To make conversational AI more intuitive, we announced&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow?cx=1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dialogflow CX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, designed to support complex (multi-turn) conversations. It's truly omnichannel—you build it once and deploy it everywhere, both in your contact center and digital channels.&nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We also continue to make enhancements to &lt;b&gt;Contact Center AI&lt;/b&gt;. These include Agent Assist for Chat, a new module that provides agents with continuous support over chat in addition to voice calls by identifying intent and providing real-time, step-by-step assistance. Read more about the latest updates in&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/conversational-ai-drives-better-customer-experiences"&gt;Conversational AI drives better customer experiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We announced a number of solutions that leverage AI to help with industry-specific challenges. &lt;b&gt;Lending Document AI&lt;/b&gt;, a new, specialized solution powered by&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/document-ai"&gt;Document AI&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;for the mortgage industry, automates many routine document reviews and speeds up loan applications. &lt;b&gt;Procure-to-Pay Document AI&lt;/b&gt;,&nbsp;now in beta, helps companies automate the procurement cycle. And&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/media-translation"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Media Translation API&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;provides real-time speech translation from streaming audio data.&nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And as a reminder, last week we announced that&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/on-prem"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speech-to-Text On-Prem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first of our hybrid AI offerings, is now generally available.

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I am excited to welcome you to &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/" target="_blank"&gt;Google Cloud Next ‘20: OnAir&lt;/a&gt;, our first digital event series that gives our community an opportunity to learn from top industry leaders and get inspired by our latest cloud innovations.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’ve all experienced, the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we live and work—for citizens, communities and organizations. At Google Cloud, we’ve been touched by how heroically and graciously people and organizations everywhere have stepped up to the challenge, and we have been humbled by the opportunity to support them during this period of profound change. Remote work, telemedicine, digital banking and distance learning have all become new standards in today’s environment.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we face a period of gradual recovery, we see organizations shifting to digital models to sell to and service customers, to deliver products and services and even to design and manufacture products. These changes have driven many organizations to modernize their technology infrastructure rapidly using the cloud to pivot quickly, optimize costs and prepare for the future.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Google Cloud is to accelerate our customers’ ability to digitally transform and reimagine their businesses through data-powered innovation. We offer three primary capabilities to help you: global-scale distributed infrastructure as a service, a digital transformation platform, and industry-specific solutions powered by Google’s AI and machine learning advances. We continue to see organizations across various industries place their trust in Google Cloud because of the differentiated technology we provide to help them solve real business problems. This includes several leading global companies we’ve recently &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0714/next-onair-customer-roundup"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0706/deutsche-bank-and-google"&gt;Deutsche Bank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0714/fox-sports-teams-up-with-google-cloud"&gt;FOX Sports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0714/google-cloud-procter-gamble-consumers"&gt;Procter &amp;amp; Gamble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com//press-releases/2020/0709/groupe-renault-and-google-cloud"&gt;Group Renault&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0611/google-cloud-telefonica-partnership"&gt;Telefónica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0713/vz-google-announcement"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;—to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve made many significant advances in our technology and we have several important updates to share with you as we kick off Next OnAir. Here are just a few of the important areas where we are introducing new capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infrastructure enhancements&lt;/b&gt;: We continue to expand our global footprint, opening several &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/new-google-cloud-region-in-jakarta-now-open"&gt;new regions&lt;/a&gt; over the last year, with plans for many more. We have introduced new capabilities in compute with expanded availability of our &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/bare-metal-solution-comes-to-five-new-google-cloud-regions"&gt;Bare Metal solution&lt;/a&gt;; in storage with &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/high-performance-cloud-file-storage"&gt;our high scale file solutions&lt;/a&gt;; and in new networking with enhancements to our CDN, Cloud Armor, and Network Intelligence Center solutions. We have also introduced important new &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/active-assist-comes-to-google-cloud"&gt;machine learning-powered capabilities&lt;/a&gt; to make our infrastructure significantly easier for you to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-cloud application m&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;odernization&lt;/b&gt;: We continue to see &lt;a href="https://cloudblog.withgoogle.com/topics/anthos/anthos-for-aws-is-now-ga/amp/" target="_blank"&gt;rapid uptake of Anthos&lt;/a&gt; and have introduced new capabilities that bring Anthos to bare metal hybrid environments, and to other clouds including Microsoft Azure and AWS. We also continue to build tools to help you migrate and modernize a broad array of enterprise workloads to Google Cloud.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-cloud analytics&lt;/b&gt;: We are introducing &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0714/bigqueryomni"&gt;BigQuery Omni&lt;/a&gt;, our new multi-cloud analytics solution—powered by Anthos—which extends our analytics platform to other public clouds, allowing you to use BigQuery’s familiar interface to break down data silos and create actionable business insights, all from a single pane of glass.

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last several months, I’ve seen first-hand how the power of knowledge-sharing and community has galvanized our customers in the face of an unprecedented global pandemic. Our customers are asking important questions, forging partnerships, and creating real solutions to today’s most challenging problems by harnessing the power of the cloud, and each other. It’s been nothing short of inspiring. We know from experience that when we support our customers and expand their access to insights and community, there’s no limit to what they can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re excited today to launch a new, independent community for our customers, C2C (Customer to Community). C2C is a platform that will bring together IT executives, developers, and other cloud professionals from Google Cloud customers across the globe. By building a community where our customers can learn, connect, and share knowledge, we can harness our collective power to create an even better cloud to address customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who join C2C will receive exclusive networking opportunities, as well as visibility into the Google Cloud ecosystem, with benefits such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to make connections and learn from other customers, including sharing knowledge and best practices through virtual and in-person events;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanded access to Google Cloud experts and content, such as knowledge forums, white papers, and methodologies;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early and exclusive access to Google Cloud product roadmaps, with opportunities to provide feedback and act as customer-advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re inviting all customers in North America and EMEA to join C2C, and we look forward to expanding the community to more regions and more customers in the coming weeks and months. So click &lt;a href="http://c2cglobal.com" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to join us today and, together, let’s shape the future of the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses run key applications in the cloud to take advantage of lower cost and increased global availability, security, and elasticity. And increasingly, enterprises are looking for more—they want greater deployment flexibility, they want to unlock the value of data through analytics and AI/ML, and they want to take advantage of the technology ecosystems that the cloud enables.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet this demand, independent software vendors (ISVs) are asking more of their public cloud partners. It’s no longer enough to simply run their products in the cloud, it’s becoming imperative to transform. This means adopting more agile, multi-cloud architectures and practices for portability, and the ability to form true partnerships that enable innovation and differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re announcing the &lt;b&gt;Google Cloud ISV/SaaS Center of Excellence&lt;/b&gt; (CoE), a new resource to help ISVs accelerate this cloud transformation journey. Whether ISVs are transforming their applications with open, cloud-agnostic architectures, transforming their users’ experience through AI/ML and voice, or delivering intelligent insight from their applications by providing rich analytics to business users, the CoE can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISV Solution Architects within the CoE bring product, technology and solution architecture expertise across Google Cloud and other Google product areas. They help ISVs create effective deployments of their apps onto GCP while leveraging best practices and methodologies from Google’s own devops/SRE capabilities from delivering our own applications at massive scale, and their experience accelerating cloud journeys for many of the world’s top ISVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The (multi-)cloud transformation journey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to cloud transformation journeys. Many ISV are working with customers to migrate business critical applications from on-premises to the cloud, either ‘lifting-and-shifting’ as quickly and easily as possible, or more often taking the opportunity to upgrade and adopt modern, cloud native architectures based on containers, microservices, serverless and open source software. Others are transforming not just their products, but their business models as they transition to a managed service or SaaS model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a common theme to these journeys: multi-cloud. ISVs are leveraging multiple public clouds, or adopting a hybrid Google Cloud and on-premises/edge model, to deliver higher availability, expand globally while meeting local regulatory requirements, enable their customers to run in environments best-suited for their business, and/or avoid vendor lock-in. The CoE has unique expertise in building and deploying applications on Google Cloud’s &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos"&gt;Anthos platform&lt;/a&gt; and designing cloud-agnostic architectures based on open source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.temenos.com/us/community/partners/google-cloud/" target="_blank"&gt;Temenos&lt;/a&gt;, a leading banking ISV, announced a &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0121/temenos-google-cloud-partnership"&gt;global, strategic partnership with Google Cloud earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Temenos leveraged the CoE to deliver their suite of banking software and applications both within the customer’s own Google Cloud environment, and via a Software-as-a-Service model. Temenos leveraged Anthos to help customers deploy mission-critical workloads across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has been explosive growth of cloud adoption in the banking industry, and we are delighted to partner with Google Cloud to deliver our software as a service on Google Cloud, and across multiple cloud platforms with Anthos,” said Tony Coleman, Product Director, Temenos Technology. “Working with the ISV/SaaS CoE has enabled us to move faster by gaining access to hands-on technical knowledge when we need it and providing access to expertise deep within Google.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Innovation and differentiation through collaboration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CoE is also committed to helping ISVs transform their existing products, or develop new ones. The CoE is helping ISVs embed intelligence to enable automation and predictability, embed voice, video, search and chat-based interfaces to change UI/UX, and help their business users act on real time insight by blending first party data with external third party data without needing data scientists.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CoE co-innovates with ISVs using Google Cloud’s broad solution portfolio including AI/ML solutions like Contact Center AI or Cloud Healthcare API, smart analytics capabilities like BigQuery and AutoML tables, and enterprise collaboration tools like Google Meet. ISVs also create truly unique and differentiated solutions by leveraging the CoE’s expertise and strong connections with broader Google product areas like Google Shopping, Ads, Maps, Pay, Assistant, Android and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenText, the industry leading Information Management software provider, selected Google as their &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/partners/helping-opentext-customers-move-enterprise-information-management-workloads-to-google-cloud"&gt;preferred partner&lt;/a&gt; for cloud-based Digital Experience Platform (DXP) customer experience management deployments. Users of OpenText’s DXP customer experience management solution often use Google’s Marketing Platform. To drive more personalized, relevant and engaging experiences that ultimately result in higher conversion rates, customers want to blend their first party data with data sources across Google Analytics 360, Ads and YouTube. The CoE, OpenText, Google Marketing Platform and the Smart Analytics teams are co-innovating to bring that vision to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Google Cloud provides a compelling platform for companies to securely manage their content and applications, with planetary scale and opportunities for innovation,” said Lou Blatt, CMO at OpenText. “But customers want more. The ISV/SaaS CoE, has enabled us to bring together expertise across Google Cloud and wider Google product areas to deliver a truly unique solution to our common customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more, and get started with the CoE, reach out to your Google Cloud partner manager or visit &lt;a href="https://www.partneradvantage.goog/GCPPRM/s/partneradvantageportallogin?language=en_US" target="_blank"&gt;Google Cloud Partner Advantage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

   <title>Caring for caregivers: UNC’s Heroes Health Initiative supports healthcare workers’ mental health</title>

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has put a huge strain on the U.S. healthcare system and its people. First responders and healthcare workers on the frontlines face incredible challenges, both physical and mental. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/health/coronavirus-ptsd-medical-workers.html?campaign_id=9&amp;amp;emc=edit_nn_20200517&amp;amp;instance_id=18563&amp;amp;nl=the-morning&amp;amp;regi_id=129809848&amp;amp;segment_id=28165&amp;amp;te=1&amp;amp;user_id=4c677973ef446d5da7297d537ab25d53" target="_blank"&gt;Healthcare workers were vulnerable to depression and suicide&lt;/a&gt; before COVID-19. Now the problem is more acute, with first responders and frontline healthcare workers &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2763229" target="_blank"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; alarming rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help these workers cope with the stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact they have on their mental health, researchers and clinicians at the University of North Carolina created the Heroes Health Initiative in partnership with Google Cloud and volunteers from across Alphabet. The &lt;a href="https://heroeshealth.unc.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Heroes Health app&lt;/a&gt; is available free of charge through &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.unc.heroeshealth&amp;amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heroes-health/id1504122094" target="_blank"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; to any healthcare worker in the United States, with additional features for healthcare institutions that want to deploy it across their organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individual healthcare workers, the Heroes Health app delivers short mental health self-assessments each week, and displays symptom summary reports to help them better understand the state of their own mental health—and changes over time. The app also provides links to immediate support and mental health resources, emphasizing free and low-cost services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-image_full_width"&gt;&lt;div class="article-module h-c-page"&gt;&lt;div class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "&gt;&lt;img alt="UNC Heroes Health Initiative .jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/UNC_Heroes_Health_Initiative_.max-1000x1000.jpg"/&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image__caption "&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Image source: &lt;a href="https://heroeshealth.unc.edu/"&gt;UNC Heroes Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many workers don’t show outward signs of the stress they’re facing, which can make it difficult for organizations to identify who needs extra support. For healthcare organizations, Heroes Health provides a way to identify and proactively reach out to workers who might need help (with the worker’s explicit permission). Aggregate reports by unit, profession, or department can help an organization understand if a particular group is facing outsized stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Heroes Health Initiative is spearheaded by UNC School of Medicine physician &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/anesthesiology/research/faculty-staff/faculty-1/sa-mclean/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Samuel McLean&lt;/a&gt;, Research Vice-Chair in the Department of Anesthesiology and an attending physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine. As a practicing emergency physician and COVID-19 survivor who contracted the virus and infected two of his family members, Dr. McLean witnessed and experienced firsthand the stress that frontline healthcare workers are under.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. McLean needed a technology partner to help bring his initiative to life. Volunteers from across Google Cloud and Alphabet, including our “moonshot factory” &lt;a href="https://x.company/" target="_blank"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;, worked in close collaboration with UNC on the project—everyone from engineers and scientists to product and program managers helped out. Google Cloud is providing free credits from our &lt;a href="https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/research/?modal_active=none" target="_blank"&gt;academic research credits program&lt;/a&gt; to host the Heroes Health app, which is built on the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/healthcare-life-sciences"&gt;FDA MyStudies on Google Cloud solution&lt;/a&gt;. UNC chose this solution for Heroes Health because it gives them the ability to connect directly with healthcare workers quickly and compliantly. Google Cloud’s &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/hipaa/"&gt;HIPAA-compliance-supporting platform&lt;/a&gt; and enterprise-level security features ensure that healthcare customers like the Heroes Health Initiative maintain complete control over their data.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Heroes Health app is now available to all individual healthcare workers and first responders nationwide. The initiative is being piloted at UNC Health and will soon roll out to first responder and healthcare organizations across the United States. Some of the first organizations that will deploy Heroes Health include UNC, Cooper University Healthcare, Rhode Island Hospital, Brown University, Indiana University Health, and Jefferson Health. Organizations can learn more about joining the Heroes Health Initiative &lt;a href="https://heroeshealth.unc.edu/welcome-to-the-heroes-health-initiative/institutions/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mental health of first responders and healthcare workers is critically important, especially as they face increased stress related to COVID-19. We are proud to support these frontline workers through the Heroes Health app.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit UNC’s website to &lt;a href="https://heroeshealth.unc.edu/welcome-to-the-heroes-health-initiative/how-we-support-healthcare-workers/" target="_blank"&gt;learn more about the Heroes Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/contact"&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt; to see how your organization can build and launch similar initiatives with &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/healthcare-life-sciences"&gt;FDA MyStudies on Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-related_article_tout"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout h-c-page"&gt;&lt;section class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;a class="uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker" data-analytics='{ "event": "page interaction", "category": "article lead", "action": "related article - inline", "label": "article: {slug}" }' href="https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/fda-mystudies-comes-to-google-cloud/"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow"&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image" style="background-image: url('')"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content"&gt;&lt;h4 class="uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin"&gt;Google Cloud and FDA MyStudies: Harnessing real-world data for medical research&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__body"&gt;Medical research firms will soon be able to deploy FDA MyStudies on Google Cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted"&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class="icon h-c-icon" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#mi-arrow-forward" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As businesses consider the road ahead, many are finding they need to make tough decisions about what projects to prioritize and how to allocate resources. For many, the impact of COVID-19 has brought the benefits and limitations of their IT environment into focus. As these businesses plan their way forward, many will need to consider how to meet the needs of their new business realities with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a challenge ideally suited for IT—particularly any&nbsp; business overly reliant on legacy infrastructure. A &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unlocking-business-acceleration-in-a-hybrid-cloud-world#" target="_blank"&gt;recent McKinsey study&lt;/a&gt; found that these legacy systems account for 74% of a company’s IT spend while hampering agility at the same time. Making fundamental IT changes like migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud can reduce costs, increase agility, and pay ROI dividends down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is covered in our new eGuide, &lt;a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/operational_efficiency_whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Solving for operational efficiency with Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. While modernization will look different for businesses of varying sizes and in varying industries, the benefits of moving to the cloud are broad and universal. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing agility and reducing IT costs by adopting hybrid and multi-cloud strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving a higher return on ERP investments by migrating SAP systems to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding costly hardware refreshes and reducing on-premises infrastructure costs by migrating VMs to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing scalability and gaining access to advanced analytics through data warehouse modernization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make cluster management easier and more cost-effective by migrating on-premises Apache Hadoop clusters to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaining cost efficiencies by running specialized workloads in the cloud with a scalable Bare Metal Solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing flexibility and decreasing on-premises investments by migrating Windows workloads to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embrace a modern architecture for scalability and cost efficiencies by offloading a mainframe environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveraging AI to rapidly respond to customer needs and improve customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaining more visibility and control to lower costs with billing and cost management tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving productivity by transforming the way teams work together with cloud-native collaboration tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With current business conditions, organizations need facts, knowledge, and best practices so they can prioritize investments and optimize costs. Our eGuide provides an overview of the key areas we see our customers prioritizing their investments and creating operational efficiencies, and highlights the many ways Google Cloud can support you in your journey. &lt;a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/operational_efficiency_whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Read the eGuide&lt;/a&gt;. If you want more customized recommendations, take advantage of our &lt;a href="https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/cost-optimization/dl-cd.html" target="_blank"&gt;IT Cost Assessment program&lt;/a&gt; which will analyze your individual IT spend against industry benchmark data and provide you with a view of cost optimization opportunities. &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/new-it-cost-assessment-program"&gt;Learn more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="block-related_article_tout"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout h-c-page"&gt;&lt;section class="h-c-grid"&gt;&lt;a class="uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker" data-analytics='{ "event": "page interaction", "category": "article lead", "action": "related article - inline", "label": "article: {slug}" }' href="https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/topics/inside-google-cloud/new-it-cost-assessment-program/"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow"&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__image" style="background-image: url('')"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="uni-related-article-tout__content"&gt;&lt;h4 class="uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin"&gt;New IT Cost Assessment program: Unlock value to reinvest for growth&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="uni-related-article-tout__body"&gt;Our new IT Cost Assessment program lets you understand how your company’s IT spend compares to your industry peers, so you can quickly id...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted"&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class="icon h-c-icon" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#mi-arrow-forward" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in IT, chances are you’re under pressure to prioritize investments and optimize costs in response to the current economic climate. According to a recent survey of our customers&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, that situation describes 84% of IT decision makers. Likewise, Forrester Research has said CIOs could face a minimum of 5% budget cuts in 2020&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and IDC is forecasting a 5.1% decline in worldwide IT spending&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. These are sobering numbers.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here at Google Cloud, we understand the need for clear, actionable ways to optimize your IT costs—and the flexibility to adjust your IT spend to the most critical areas dynamically. To help, we developed a new IT Cost Assessment program that lets you understand how your company’s IT spend compares to your industry peers, so you can quickly identify key areas of opportunity to unlock value to reinvest for growth.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud has a proven and structured approach to validate these IT cost reduction opportunities. Every business is unique, but knowing where you stand relative to your industry peers is an invaluable piece of insight when strategizing how to survive in this new economic reality. The first thing we do with our IT cost assessment is analyze your individual IT spend and compare it to industry benchmark data derived from our extensive experience working with clients and trusted third-party research firms, providing you a view of cost optimization opportunities.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in a second phase, we propose Google Cloud solutions best aligned to helping you reap the benefits of IT cost reductions, reduce physical infrastructure complexity, leverage hybrid-cloud strategy and enhance security, compliance and flexibility. In addition, our differentiated capabilities across AI/ML &amp;amp; Big Data can help you identify opportunities to optimize processes and drive additional operational efficiencies.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have this baseline of your performance, we deliver a detailed TCO analysis, ROI projections, and an implementation plan, with Google Cloud solutions that will help you migrate and modernize your legacy environment and deliver a positive impact to your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have partnered with leading enterprise companies in manufacturing, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, and insurance sectors, among others and delivered cost savings across their IT environments. In the aforementioned customer survey, three out of four respondents reported savings of up to 30% in the first 6 months of becoming a Google Cloud customer. And presented with the statement, "Google Cloud helped me increase our operational efficiency and optimize IT spend," nine in ten agreed.&lt;/p&gt;Click here to learn more about the &lt;a href="https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/cost-optimization/dl-cd.html" target="_blank"&gt;IT Cost Assessment program&lt;/a&gt;, and to request an engagement. We look forward to helping you navigate—and thrive—through these challenging times.&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;1.
